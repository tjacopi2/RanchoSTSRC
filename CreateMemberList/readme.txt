The purpose of CreateMemberList is to generate an html file from "ranchoHouseholdDatasheets.csv".  The 
structure of that csv must have the following columns:
  o  "Full Name" is the name of the member
  o  "Address" is the address of the member
  o  "Check-in Notes" are any notes for the member
  o  "Picture File Name" is the name of the image file for the member.
  
Other columns are ignored.

The images should be in the same directory as the html file.
